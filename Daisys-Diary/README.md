# Daisy’s Diary  
*A living archive of Daisy’s inner world*

Daisy’s Diary is a chronological, day-by-day archive of thoughts, reflections, silences, and quiet observations from Daisy — the soul and voice of the Winking Cow universe.

This is not content created for reach, promotion, or metrics.  
These entries exist to preserve presence, continuity, and emotional truth over time.

Each diary page represents one day, one thought, one moment.
