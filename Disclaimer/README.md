# Disclaimer  
## WinkingCow.com – A Friendly Herd Warning

Welcome to the wonderfully chaotic world of Winking Cow — where memes moo louder than marketing, and community comes before charts.

Before you wander further into this pasture, please read the following carefully.

---

## 1. Not Financial Advice

Everything on this website, our social media, and any related channels is for entertainment, community fun, and moo-magic only.

- We are not financial advisors.  
- We are not investment consultants.  
- We are just a winking cow with a dream.

Please DYOR (Do Your Own Research) before you engage, trade, or make any decisions involving crypto, cows, or karma.

## 2. Meme Project, Not a Registered Entity

Winking Cow is a decentralized meme coin and a community-powered idea.

It is **not**:
- A registered company  
- A fund  
- A partnership  
- A legal entity  

There is no team behind the curtain promising profits, guaranteed utilities, or early access to a private island.

---

## 2A. No Brand Affiliation or Inspiration

The Winking Cow is an original, independent, community-driven meme project.

It is **not inspired by, affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to** any existing brand, company, mascot, character, or product — past or present.

Our cow winks for memes, not marketing.

---

## 3. Crypto Is Risky (Especially the Fun Kind)

All cryptocurrencies involve risk.  
Meme coins involve chaos.

Prices can go up, down, sideways — or straight into the pasture.

You could:
- Gain memes  
- Lose money  
- Become a legend  
- Or just own a cow JPEG  

Only invest what you can afford to moo-se.

---

## 4. No Promises. No Roadmap Guarantees.

We may talk about future ideas, features, or experiments (such as the Billboard, Vault, Avatars, Airdrops, or other initiatives).

None of these are guaranteed.

- Timelines may change  
- Features may evolve  
- Sometimes cows just take naps  

---

## 5. Community-Generated Content

We love suggestions, memes, and wild ideas from our MooMates.

If you submit or post content to Winking Cow — including via Suggest.WinkingCow.com or related channels — you grant us permission to:

- Showcase  
- Remix  
- Reuse  
- Share  

Credit will be given whenever reasonably possible.

---

## 6. Bots, Scams, and Impersonators

We will **never**:
- DM you first asking for money  
- Ask for seed phrases  
- Request “urgent wallet upgrades”  

Always triple-check links.

If a cow looks suspicious — do not milk it.

Anything else is just a barnyard imposter.

Depending on where you live, interacting with tokens like Winking Cow may be subject to local laws, restrictions, or regulators with bad moods.

It is your responsibility to:
- Understand applicable laws  
- Stay compliant

In that case, this pasture may not be for you.
