# Stickers

This folder contains the official Winking Cow sticker archive.

All stickers stored here have already been publicly released through the
official Winking Cow X (Twitter) account and are preserved in this repository
as a documented visual archive of the project.

## Structure

Stickers are organized by year of release.


Files inside each year folder are intentionally kept flat.
Each sticker is self-described through a standardized filename that reflects
its mood, theme, or message.

## File Format & Size

- All stickers are provided in PNG format
- Aspect ratios may vary based on original release context
- Files in this repository are compressed versions

High-resolution source files are intentionally not hosted here.

## Purpose

This archive exists for:
- Documentation
- Transparency
- Historical reference
- Community visibility

All files have been compressed to respect GitHub server space
and responsible storage practices.

## Usage

Stickers may be shared freely in community conversations.
Commercial reuse or misrepresentation of the Winking Cow identity is not permitted.
Credit is appreciated where applicable.
